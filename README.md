   * ###   Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
 
     * ### Ground clearance and vehicle length provided non-random amounts of variance to the mpg values provided in the dataset.
&nbsp;
   * ### Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? 
      * ### The slopes of the predictive coefficients ground_clearance and vehicle_length are not zero in the linear model (or the couldn't be very predictive...),  ground_clearance has a slope of about 3.5 and vehicle_length has a slope of about 6.3. 
&nbsp;
   * ### Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? 
      * ### The coefficients ground_clearance and vehicle_length effectively predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively because they have p-values less than 0.001.  The other coefficiants are above 0.05 and as such are not considered effective predictors

 * ###  In reviewing the design specifications of the suspension coils it has been measured that Lot 3 is outside of the requirements.  A maximum variance is 100 psi while Lot 3 has a variance of over 170 psi.  Lot 1 and Lot 2 do meet the specifications with Lot 1 having a variance of just under 1 and the Lot 2 variance being about 7.5.
