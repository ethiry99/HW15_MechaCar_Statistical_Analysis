## Linear Regression to Predict MPG (Deliverable #1)

   * ###   Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
 
     * ### Ground clearance and vehicle length provided non-random amounts of variance to the mpg values provided in the dataset.
&nbsp;
   * ### Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? 
      * ### The slopes of the predictive coefficients ground_clearance and vehicle_length are not zero in the linear model (or the couldn't be very predictive...),  ground_clearance has a slope of about 3.5 and vehicle_length has a slope of about 6.3. 
&nbsp;
   * ### Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? 
      * ### The coefficients ground_clearance and vehicle_length effectively predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively because they have p-values less than 0.001.  The other coefficiants are above 0.05 and as such are not considered effective predictors
